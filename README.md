## The making of the maps and Facts

### About the map (details/facts)

The theme of SM227 was/is "Thunderbolts and lighting", i simply said : ok let's do a map where the main focus is using the Lightning gun (as if taking things literally huh?), i really playtested the map a lot so the player doesn't run out of LG ammo.

I used a func_door that act as a button, that points to a trigger_counter to open the main door before the map climax, i was doing this in a personal copper 1.30 map and i decided to do it here... there's a slight issue where the player MAY fall stuck with the button, but it seems benign and solvable with noclip (i apologize), regardless, chances of this bug happening are low.

### Extra: Who are "The Disciples of Shub Niggurath"?

I have frequent people that help me on with my maps, so it is with coding projects, so i decided to make a small group list(non-related or attached) of those that help me, the intention is that it sounds like a band, so, i'll list it as it was written with some modifications (this is some sort of "wholesome meme", don't worry, just Chuma being Chuma/ myself being myself):

## The Disciples of Shub Niggurath:

- Chuma (main mapper)

- Forte (Co mapper and designer, helps a lot)
- CommonCold (Co mapper and designer also Deadpool, helps a lot)
- EmeraldTiger (Co mapper and designer also a Kamen Raider, helps a lot but has a Kamen raider suit more points)

- bmFbr (Technical/Coding/design assistance , John Carmack in disguise but he denies it)
- Admer (Technical/Coding/design assistance, if bm is John Carmack, Admer is an Eldritch entity)
- Makkon (Art assistance , Adrian Carmack would be proud except he hasn't made a statue)

- MopeyBloke (Tester, he da best bug finder and feedback)
- RecycledOJ (Compatibility tester, He is the only one using Quakespasm and not the spiked one)

- Yuyi and Alunadrern (They are my best friends but they actually give me RGB values when i ask them for feedback and help (FOG and Sky values), so in theory they are the "Sun and moon" of "Chuma's Quake maps universe" {Thanks for this joke Admer}
